# Webapp

This webapp uses php framework Laravel. It allows for handling book lists:
- adding a new book
- delete a book
- display all books
- export all books in CSV or XML format, optionally filtering out the author or
the titles

Adding a book leads to its dedicated URL (`/book/<book_id>`) where a list of 
recommended books appears, based on the title and optionally the author. This
list of books is generated by the NLP service _recommend_ and sent over HTTP.

The database used for the webapp is different than the one used in the NLP
service, where only a list of books used for training the LSI model is present.
The LSI model therefore does not update according to given input from the 
webapp.

## Tools
The Makefile allows to perform tasks:
```
init                           Install dependencies
dockerize                      Dockerize
help                           Display this message
```

## Usage

The app uses the `.env` for Laravel envrionment variables, including the
connection to MySQL DB, and `config/nlp_api.php` for configuring variables
related to the NLP services API.

### NLP API config file

The configuration file `config/nlp_api.php`: 
```
<?php
return [
    'host' => 'http://localhost:5000'   // the host and port for the NLP API
];
```

## TODO

- testing

### Ideas and improvments

- add login page and forbid guest users from adding and deleting books
